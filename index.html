            <h3>Become a Programmer</h3>
            <p id="hola">In this world no one know what will happen next with him/her but they wanted to make things better. This world is full of hate thunder and it became so much powerful that anyone who wanted to be good day by day can't be that guy. I always wanted to know about the time travel. How time works. I wanted to know about the multiverse. This type of topics make my dopamin erase.

                <p>life is so unfair for somebody. Why it happens I don't know. Is that anyone's fault? Someone have a life with a lot of money and also have a beautiful family. They have everything they want in life. but some of the people around the world doesn't have this kind of life. I had meet a boy who was crying for some food the day before Eid ul Adha. All he wanted was food. but he didn't get any</p>

                <h1>Baby Web Developer</h1>
                <h3><span class="name">baccha kaler web Developer ami</span></h3>
                <p>On the otherhand there are some people whom are so priviliged that they can eat food and also waste it. I always wonder how they will meet up with Allah.
                How the judgement will happen for both of them. May Allah give both of them Jannatul Ferdous. for me this unfair things are not normal because I don't know the deept things. I'm greatful for what I have. Alhamdulillah.
